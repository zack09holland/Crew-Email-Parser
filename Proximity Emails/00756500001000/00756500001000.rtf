Photos of single exit, 40FT south and 15 Ft west of meter, sewer exits onto back patio.  Based on the slope/distance, itâ€™s not possible for sewer to exit to 9th, no plumbing around where gas runs, meter attaches to an office.  Confirmed single exit on west side.  Storm also exits west to Aloha.  This guy spent the weekend digging up the area under his porch attempting to find an ACOP with no luck.   If we have to push this he would prefer a crawlspace push.
