Gas runs from 15th down the N side of the driveway.  This guy was not cool with a toilet pull, flushed a sonde and located west of the house.  Sorry for all the photos, the slope was difficult to show due to the overgrowth.  There is no plumbing within 20ft of the meter, it is stacked on the south side, the main stack is 50ft south of the gas at the NE corner.  There is one bathroom in the basement, 20ft south of the gas, 20ft west of gas, and downhill.  I donâ€™t think this could go up to 15th unless it was pumped, I tried to look for a manhole in the back but theres about 30ft of garden before a straight drop off.
