Photos of Wye Right W2H.  I don’t think this will look like it is heading towards gas, seems like it would be north of it based on mapping, but I didn’t locate gas at this one.  W2H leads to the C/O cap stub in the photo, I confirmed it with the guy that put it in.  I couldn’t get it open with a pry bar or a manhole hook, it looks like it’s the kind with the black rubber gasket on the inside.  Everyone involved with this house was onsite discussing some porch glass that broke when installed so I didn’t think it was wise to take a hammer to it.
