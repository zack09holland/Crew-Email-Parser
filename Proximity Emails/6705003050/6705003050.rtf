Photos for crawlspace, ACOH runs to vent on S side of house for exterior access, all plumbing is on S side of house, SE and SW corners tie in and enter the ground in a straight line, but there is not a single discernable exit point that is visible.  The tie in in the video is the green pipe the camera drops into, I was able to string it through, the ACOH line angles west the SE plumbing bends west, everything appears to tie together and exit the N side of the NW corner of the house and run N.  I had water run at SE corner to confirm.
