Parcel 53033_6788201415_00

2303 25th Ave E, Seattle

The city has the mainline listed as 10in, However it is not. The mainline is a 90in. I ran as much as I could to show that it does not reduce to 10in. Tap was found at 15.7ft from upstream manhole. Please refer this to prox, push has already been here and bill put reference in comment section. Thank You
