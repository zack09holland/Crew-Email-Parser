Photos of roots and wye, the first roots in the video are under the fountain at the corner of the front yard, at the center of the fountain.  If this is a candidate for a pothole, the roots at F9A are probably best.  There is no way to get a large cleaning machine into the basement, I don’t think it would fit through the door.  There’s a pipe change to white plastic at R0A, same stuff the downspout runs into in the photos.  I maxed out the small cleaning machine prior to taking this video.  There was some root accumulation after the cleaning, I had to use the camera to push the line clear, the lens fogged up a bit on the inside.  I tried cleaning and running cool water over it.
