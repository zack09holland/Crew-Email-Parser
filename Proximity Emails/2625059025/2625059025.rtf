This is 3 large buildings, retirement community.  I was able to locate some of the gas to 152nd.  Each building has a cul de sac out front and manholes for a submain running through the area.  Really difficult to get subfoot anywhere.  The maintenance person showed me the parking garages, there are cleanouts on pipes that run into the ground on every vertical pillar +20 per garage x 3 buildings.  It would probably be more efficient to have ML attempt this.  I talked to the site manager Chelsea about it, she was fine w/potential ML as long as we give them some advance notice.  If this has to be a push thing, it needs more than a double block.
