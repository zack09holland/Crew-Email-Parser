Gas Runs to the SE corner of the house and sewer exits west side.  I couldn’t push outside foundation cause they had their sump hose routed into the sewer, the homeowner did not want it removed, and I wasn’t sure I could get it out/put it back right.  I took a solo GPS point on the west side for plumbing exits.  DA’s sorry for the video, his wife used the facilities during the course of the inspection and it lodged between the camera and the sump hose.  Her husband and I were actually watching the screen as this happened.  She then came down to the basement because she wanted to watch.  I didn’t take a point/observation for the obstruction as it was a little awkward…
