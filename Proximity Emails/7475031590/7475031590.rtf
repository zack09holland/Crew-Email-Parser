Photos of plumbing in crawlspace on west side, I can physically see everything tie in except for the 2 in line at the far wall that goes straight into the ground.  Couldnâ€™t get a camera or a sonde outside foundation.   This is scheduled to clean for debris, 2 man crew should be able to do the roof vent, the entire west side is concrete driveway, probably not ideal for an acop installation.  If pushed from the roof it might be clearable w/prox.
