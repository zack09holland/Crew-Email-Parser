This is the photo of the layout for the parcel.  Gas would be on top of my thumb in the photo, the BF Prev would be in Unit E under my thumb.  The primary for all units runs under the driveway parallel to gas, each pair (A/B, C/D, E/F) has a tie in to the primary.  They intersect at the East shoulder of 32nd  Ave NW, sewer turns south before the main, gas runs straight west/east.  It is new construction.
