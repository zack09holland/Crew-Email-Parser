Good Afternoon, 

Today I went to 1281 NE 69th St - Seattle - Parcel# 0525049160.  

The home owner did not give me an exact timeframe but he said they “recently” had their sewer replaced and that between wye U7Q and ACOP Y3W was replaced by pipe bursting.  The homeowner also said the water sag was there before the new pipe was burst in.

 

Let me know if you have any questions about this parcel.

 

Thank you.
