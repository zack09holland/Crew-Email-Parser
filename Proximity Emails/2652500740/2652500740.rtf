There are 2 Wyes in this line, they roughly line up with ML inspection U0G is ML K5Y, V6P is ML W9D.  In the video I didn’t get a really good look at all of U0G so I called it an offset/wye in the POSM comments.  I wasn’t able to get any locates on the roots because there is a chicken coop and the trenched cleanout I pushed from blocking access to that area.  Both wyes are pinned/painted/flagged/referenced.  Roots start after U0G.
