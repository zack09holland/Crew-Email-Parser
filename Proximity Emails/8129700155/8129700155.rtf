Photos of the plumbing on the west side of the building looking east, 2nd floor plumbing enters bldg. heading east.  Only access via the property manager is an ACOP under parking space 102 which is currently occupied.  He tried to get ahold of the tenant to get the car moved, no luck.  The ACOP is at the SE corner, there is +50 ft on the west side from the adj gas line to the foundation of the building as most of the west side is a carport/parking area.
