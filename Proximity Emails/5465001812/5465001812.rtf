WENT TO 6419 S CHEYENNE ST/53053_5465001812_00. FOUND ACCESS DOWN IN BASEMENT/CRAWLSPACE THROUGH 2IN CO. MINI CAM REQUIRED TO INSPECT SINK LINES. THE 2IN CO IS INACCESILE FOR SOLO MAN CREW. TWO MAN CREW REQUIRED. THE 2IN CO IS LOCATED ABOVE A 5FT TALL CONCRETE WALL TO THE LEFT OF THE BASEMENT DOOR WHEN YOU WALK IN. THE SINK LINE APPEARS TO BE FURTHER TO THE E PAST GAS METER. SINK LINE NEEDS TO BE INSPECTED IN ORDER TO CLEAR PARCEL. IN THE BASEMENT IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE SEWER EXITS. MAIN STACK FOR TOILETS, BATHTUBS AND SINK STACK IS FOR ALL THE SINKS IN THE HOME. (THE MAIN SEWER STACK WAS IN AN AREA THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A GOOD PHOTO OF). PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.
