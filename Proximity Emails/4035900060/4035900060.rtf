This guy’s kid was sleeping and it was not a good time for the inspection, he did let me go into the crawlspace and confirm there’s a single exit on the west side heading west.  No ACOP or access in crawlspace, 2 in cleanouts only down there.  Photos aren’t great due to the glare from the insulation.  This will either be a roof vent or a TP.  I wasn’t able to look inside the house for an acoh or at the toilets.  I gave him dispatch’s number to reschedule, took a unable to inspect and a plumbing exits point.
