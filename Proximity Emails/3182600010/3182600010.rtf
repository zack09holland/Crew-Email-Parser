WENT TO 6022 43RD AVE NE/53033_3182600010_00. APPOINTMENT WAS ORIGINALLY FOR A FLUSHABLE SONDE BUT AFTER READING NOTES BY PREVIOUS INSPECTION FROM JEFFERY DODD I CALLED PROX JAY JOHNSON AND SPOKE WITH HIM MORE ABOUT WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS A CO ON THE NORTH FOR MAIN SEWER. I SCOPED THE PROPERTY AND FOUND A 2" CO INSIDE OF GARAGE BEHIND THE WASHER AND DRYER THAT APPEARS TO LEAD TOWARDS 6016 GAS METER. THE BATHROOM AND MAIN SEWER IS OCATED ON THE NORTH SIDE AND 2" SINK LINE IS ON THE S SIDE OF HOUSE. NOTIFIED DISPATCH THAT AN APPOINTMENT FOR A MINI CAM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND CLEAR PARCEL. IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK AWAY
