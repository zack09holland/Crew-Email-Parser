Hey All,

 

Rolled up to this parcel (1708 Academy St)  and something seemed strange about how the ML segments ran. The segment I wanted did not connect to the downstream manhole, instead curved up and away down Bonney Ave. After looking around, I found a MH on Meeker Ave that runs down the alley behind the house I was attempting to inspect. The line is 6‚Äù concrete, and services the houses on the right side of Academy St. I also spoke with the homeowner and she confirmed that their sewer ran out the back into the alley. Gas for these parcels runs out the front, leaving zero risk for a potential crossbore. I recommend a proximity visit to confirm, but otherwise these can be easily cleared by DA approval.
