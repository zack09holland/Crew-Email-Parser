Good Afternoon, 

Today I went to 14842 NE 95th St - Redmond - Parcel# 9430500022.  This unit is in the SW corner of the 14840 building. In the business center this is referred to as Building #5.  I pushed my camera out and was able to follow the camera going east into Unit 14858. This unit is home to the Willows Deli restaurant.  I was not able to get around a bend while still inside foundation.  I was also underwater for most of my push and couldnâ€™t see what sort of bend I was hitting. 

 

Let me know if you have any other questions.

 

Thank you.
