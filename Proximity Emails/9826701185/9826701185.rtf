SSE heading East at east end of the unit.  All the units in the area have the same builder, they are likely similar.  124B has a pump system outside of it, couldnâ€™t see if other units to the east also have pump systems.  Gas is a shared line for 118A/B & 120A/B.  The task instructions seemed to be concerned with where ML ended up at the NW corner of the parcel, there is no sanitary in this area.  Their paint marks point to storm drains.
