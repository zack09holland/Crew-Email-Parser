Got just outside foundation from upstairs at 9736, may need to attempt 9734 (same building different tenant, but same offset if single exit).  There was a Wye Right Just beyond the Offset (farthest flag from foundation), I almost got the camera there.  No ACOP, no roof access.  No access to North Side gated area where the gas meter is, but it was shot previously.
