This one was just goofy.  6 features in the first 15ft of video, pushing from a crawlspace, all in the next door neighbors front yard/hedges/driveway(20010).  She pulled up as I was shooting the points, wasn’t upset but wasn’t really thrilled either.  My trimble stops working after a minute of direct sunlight.  The points aren’t referenced/pinned very well, I didn’t want to loiter or paint her bushes.  The offset is farthest towards the street on the lawn, the wye rights are on the lawn/hedges, and the bend left /wye 12 are the disk farthest up the driveway.
