Water Sag is flagged at the edge of the driveway in the pile of decorative rocks (photo one isnâ€™t that good).  I checked the gas in the area of the water sag, the tape measure runs over where the gas line is and is about 1.5-2 FT deep in that area.  Sewer heads NW across the driveway, gas was previously located at the far east of the parcel.
