Photos of Offset and Void points, this is set for a C/O install.  I think the void was originally called a Wye 12, I couldnâ€™t see a Wye 12 just a chunk missing from the top.  The offset is pretty big, but should be stringable if you have to install something upstream but close by.  Both points are on/under the fenceline closer to the neighbor to the south 8035.  There is only a kitchen and a bathroom, confirmed single sanitary exit.  There is a crawlspace at the SW corner of the house, but access was covered up when the basement was refinished.   The foundation point is not exact as the house has had an addition, the pipe change does not coincide exactly with where the building starts.
