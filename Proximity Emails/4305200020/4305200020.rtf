Photos of Sonde Locates on S side of house.  I was not allowed access to the area with the pump because the homeowner has a “very territorial” spaniel and that is his area of the yard.  There is an exposed pump back there, and I lost the sonde in the line close to the pump.  There’s a heavy  slope to the south.  Locate at the pump is pinned at the corner, locate on the other side of the fence is one of the white markers set on the lower horizontal rung of the fence through the screen leaned up against it.
