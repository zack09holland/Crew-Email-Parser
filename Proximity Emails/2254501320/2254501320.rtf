Everything was offset for this inspection, photos attached.  There was another inspection run nearby downstream of where I was pushing, I tried to line things up with the pins and features on mapping, but I couldn’t.  In case anyone has to go out and look at this, my pins aren’t painted (to differentiate between inspections, the tape is still there and labelled.
