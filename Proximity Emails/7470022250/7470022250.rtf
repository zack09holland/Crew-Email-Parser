Went to inspect a prev push inspection. Inspection was good, thought he did miss two bend lefts, one was in some thick bushes next to sidewalk. I reached the bend right, but due to the angle of the tractor in the MH was unable to get past it. was unable to verify the wye in question past the bend right. Not sure if you want to send push out again to try and find the wye. Iâ€™ve included a picture of our end point
