There are 2 separate sanitary exits on this house, the ACOP I pushed from is for the west side, the east side / addition joins up with it at the wye left (U3H) in the photo, I had the east side fixtures flow tested to confirm.  The exit point is visible at the base of the house.  All of this is behind the adjacent gas meter and +15ft west of it.  I had to shoot offsets from the street, so I wasnâ€™t sure how it would look on mapping.
