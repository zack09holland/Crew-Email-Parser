Photos of single exit at SW corner of house, exit is +50ft past adjacent gas risk.  If you look at the aerial view, they have a 3 car garage that is the closest building to the adjacent risk.  There is no plumbing in the garage.  Additional photos of wyes/foundation and limited access to locate in the backyard area.  The sewer runs roughly parallel to the stairs.
