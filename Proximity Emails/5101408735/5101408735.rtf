Photos attached show the wyes at the NW corner of the driveway that I could not pin, the ACOH on the west wall of the garage (cap wonâ€™t open, pipe moves when I put weight on it, all plastic), single exit from the west wall of the crawlspace, and the ACOPs on the driveway.  The ACOP at the center of the driveway is filled in with rocks, the new one at the SW corner of the driveway (stub sticking out) is the one I used.  Another scoping company found and repaired the crossbore.
