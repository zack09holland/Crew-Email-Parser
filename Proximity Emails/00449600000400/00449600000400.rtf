Roots flagged in photo, too far out for small cleaning machine and no access to get the large one inside.  I helped Kacy with the house next door (4809) , I think they had an ACOP and roots as well (there are 2 flags in the photos, mine has blue tape).  Mapping shows their lines tie together, but I think the roots in this line are upstream of that.  There’s a SSE at center of house and it turns west to meet up w/4809.  Couldn’t get a signal from gas w/the line energized.
