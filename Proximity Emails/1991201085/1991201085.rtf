SO I RAN SEGMENT 035-387_035-386 CONTAINING LATERAL ON MAPPING. I THEN RAN SEGMENT 035-386_035-367 WHERE I ALSO RAN LATERAL THAT WAS ILLISTRATED ON MAPPING, HOWEVER AT 220.9 FEET FROM DSMH THERE IS A 3RD LATERAL NOT ON MAPPING. I DID RUN WHOLE LINE AND NO CROSSBORE WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER MY RIGGER COULD NOT GET ANY LOCATES AFTER TAP AND BASED ON HIM WALKING IT OUT HE STATED FOUNDATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT 55.9FT HOWERVER I DID NOT SEE A PIPE CHANGE AND I COMPLETED THE LATERAL PIPE TO A CAPPED LINE @ 72.2FT.  The video is complete on the run through and the pullback however as far as the GPS points and not being able to get any depth Iâ€™m not sure how this line should be handled.
