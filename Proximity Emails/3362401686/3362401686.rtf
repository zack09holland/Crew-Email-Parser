Gas and Sewer both run to the east side of the house, sewer exits before the meter.   All sanitary on west side of house except Utility Sink and Kitchen Sink at the far south end, flow tested both at the Wye R neither exit behind gas, everything appears to exit at foundation.  Homeowner recently refinished the basement and seemed confident that there is a SSE.  My tap location is about 20-25ft west of ML tap.  I didnâ€™t get any signal near their mark.  If the arrows are in the way, I can send the blank photos.  I have old eyes and a short memory, so I figured they would help.  Everything that could be flagged is.
