There is a backflow preventer under foundation. Its covered by a wooden floor beam that the customer did not want cut to access it. Attempted a roof vent that the resident noted passed the backflow preventer. The roof vent had a pipe reduction down to two inches nine feet into the vent. Flushed and sacrificed a sonde and took two locates near foundation for  a CO install. Sent pictures attached to this email to Corrmick.
